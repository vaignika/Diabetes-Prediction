# Diabetes Prediction System Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project implements a machine learning-based system for predicting diabetes risk in patients. The system uses various health metrics to provide early risk assessment, potentially enabling timely medical intervention.

## Features
- Interactive web interface using Streamlit
- Real-time prediction based on user input
- Confidence score for predictions
- Comprehensive health metrics analysis
- User-friendly input validation

## Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: Streamlit (Python web framework)
- **Backend**: Python 3.10.10
- **Machine Learning**: scikit-learn
- **Data Processing**: pandas, numpy
- **Model**: Trained using [specify your algorithm, e.g., Random Forest, SVM, etc.]

## Dataset Information
The model is trained on the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset, which includes the following features:
- Number of pregnancies
- Glucose level
- Blood pressure
- Skin thickness
- Insulin level
- BMI (Body Mass Index)
- Diabetes pedigree function
- Age
